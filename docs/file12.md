Note : After completion of email sending turn off less secure apps option


#### 2. Add smtp and gmail account details in settings.py file existed in project folder

* EMAIL_USE_TLS to be enabled for security reasons. TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts all the SMTP commands.
* EMAIL_HOST is for mentioning which sever is to be connected i.e server location.
* EMAIL_PORT for giving port number of the gmsil server i.e 587 
* EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD are from which user email id is going to be send and it's password. 

```python
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True  
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'  
EMAIL_PORT = 587  
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'sender_username@gmail.com' # Your gmail ID
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '********' # Password of your gmail account
```


#### 3. Create forms.py file in app folder for generating a form with email, subject, body, file fields by using below lines of code

```python
from django import forms  
class EmailForm(forms.Form):      
    email     = forms.EmailField(label = '', max_length = 40, widget=forms.EmailInput(attrs={'placeholder':'Enter Sender Email'}))
    subject  = forms.CharField(label = '', max_length = 60, widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'placeholder':'Enter Subject of Email'}))
    body  = forms.CharField(label = '', max_length = 100, widget = forms.Textarea(attrs = {'placeholder':'Enter Email Body'}))  
    file      = forms.FileField(label = '') # for creating file input
 
```


#### 4. In views.py from app folder create a view for sending an email as shown below

* In this case myProject is projectname and email_sending is appname
	* Imported settings from myProject to access host email address and static file path
	* Imported EmailForm from forms.py in email_sending app
* EmailMessage is the classname in django.core.mail used for sending an email this class needs following parameters
	* subject: The subject line of the email.
	* body: The body text. This should be a plain text message.
	* from_email: The senderâ€™s address.
	* to: A list or tuple of recipient addresses.
* attch_file() is function of EmailMessage class 
	* It requires path of the static file to be sent as attachment
	
```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from email_sending.forms import EmailForm
from myProject import settings
from django.core.mail import EmailMessage

# Create your views here.

def sendMail(request):
	if request.method == 'POST':
		to_mail = request.POST['email']
		from_mail = settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER
		email_sub = request.POST['subject']
		email_body = request.POST['body']
		file_name = request.POST['file']
		mail = EmailMessage(email_sub, email_body, from_mail, [to_mail])
		mail.attach_file(settings.STATIC_ROOT+settings.MEDIA_URL+file_name)
		mail.send()
		return HttpResponse("<h3 style = 'color:green'>Email sent successfully..!!!</h3>")
	email_form = EmailForm()
	return render(request, 'email.html', {'form' : email_form})
```


#### 5. Create email.html file in templates folder existed in app folder with below lines of html code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Send Mail</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Email Sending</h3>
<form action="{% url 'send_mail' %}" method="POST">
	{% csrf_token %}
	{{ form.as_p }}
	<button type="submit">Send</button>  
</form>
</body>
</html>
```


#### 6. Now include sendMail view in urls.py existed in project folder

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from email_sending import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', views.sendMail, name = 'send_mail')
]
```
