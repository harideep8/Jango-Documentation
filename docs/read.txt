Contextual Classes:

Contextual classes can be used to color the table,table rows or table cells. 
The classes that can be used are: 
.table-primary,
.table-success,
.table-info,
.table-warning,
.table-danger, 
.table-active,
.table-secondary, 
.table-light and .table-dark:


Table head options:
Similar to tables and dark tables,
use the modifier classes .thead-light or .thead-dark to 
make <thead>s appear light or dark gray.

Striped rows
Use .table-striped to add zebra-striping to any table row within the <tbody>.


Bordered table
Add .table-bordered for borders on all sides of the table and cells.


Hoverable rows
Add .table-hover to enable a hover state on table rows within a <tbody>.



Responsive tables
Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive across all viewports by wrapping a .table with .table-responsive.
Or, pick a maximum breakpoint with which to have a responsive table up to by using .table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}.



Breakpoint specific
Use .table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} as needed to create responsive tables up to a particular breakpoint. From that breakpoint and up, the table will behave normally and not scroll horizontally.

These tables may appear broken until their responsive styles apply at specific viewport widths.
